### Website Portfolio Hedrin Sitorus

"This is a web portfolio that I created with a simple approach. As a minimalist, I believe that less is more, and I aimed to showcase my skills and work in a clear and concise way. I wanted to create a user-friendly platform that would allow visitors to easily navigate and appreciate my projects without any distractions. Overall, my goal was to create a polished and professional representation of my work and abilities."
